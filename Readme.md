This is a repo which contains test cases for the Nintendo 3DS.
The main purpose is to validate findings and test them on real hardware.

This is throwaway-code.
Code quality is horrible and unless you have reasons to be here you shouldn't look at anything.
The different tests are supposed to aid development of Citra, a 3DS emulator.
